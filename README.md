Matlab GUI which randomly asks three questions and normal values on medical physiolgy. The original questions and physiological normal values are public in our department web site (http://www.phys.szote.u-szeged.hu/index.php?lap=2&id=en).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
* The code has been tested in Matlab version 8.6 (R2015b).

### How to use
1. Launch your Matlab.
2. Load Physiology.mat file and you will find two variables in your Workspace (Objectives and NormalValue).
3. Launch Physiology.fig

* You can do the above procedure by launching cells one-by-one in PhysiologyPrep.m file.
* Objective and NormalValues are cells which have a string in each cell.
* You can change strings and utilize it to another purpose.
